# Simple Linear Regression Implementation

In this r markdown I implemented my own custom simple linear regression method which uses both qr-decomposition
and inverse methods using matrix algebra. Also produces confidence and/or prediction intervals. 

After implementing the function I tested this on numerous datasets found in the data_storage subdirectory, some are linear
and some violate the simple linear regression assumptions. Those that violate the assumptions, I attempted to use transformations, 
to get a better fit.
