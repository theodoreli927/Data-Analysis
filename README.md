# Data-Analysis
A repository for practicing data analysis and different types of model fitting techniques
All practices are done in R studio which includes a R Markdown file and a knitted pdf

# LOESS_dwKNN
A exercise where I implement my own custom loess() to perform smoothing on linear regression based on the span and degree passed in as arguments.
Also implemented a custom distance-weighted kNN in an attempt at better accuracy for unsupervised learning.

# Simple Linear Regression
Implemented my own custom lm function which creates a regression model based on both qr-decomposition and inverse matrix methods (depending on the arguments)
Additionally, creates confidence and/or prediction intervals based on the model.
