Created a custom LOESS function for smoothing based on the span and degree passed in. Proceeded to analyze the performance of the model fits using the ozone dataset.
Compared the MSE with the built-in LOESS function along visualizations.

Created a custom distance weighted KNN for both classification and regression.
